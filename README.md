# Absolute-MESS
Absolute MESS is a Python script that makes your computer screen look like a static, glitchy TV screen. It adds a laggy, distorted overlay effect on top of your screen to mimic the appearance of a malfunctioning display. The effect is achieved by capturing the screen, processing the frame, and adding visual noise and static.
