# Absolute-MESS
Absolute MESS is a Python script that makes your computer screen look like a static, glitchy TV screen. It adds a laggy, distorted overlay effect on top of your screen to mimic the appearance of a malfunctioning display. The effect is achieved by capturing the screen, processing the frame, and adding visual noise and static.

## Features 
1. Laggy TV Effect: Adds a visual effect that mimics a glitchy, static-filled TV screen.
2. Full-Screen Overlay: The overlay takes up the full screen and stays on top of all other windows.
3. Real-time Glitching: Constantly captures the screen and applies frame differencing to generate the glitchy effect.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
```
pip install opencv-python PyQt5 numpy mss
```
